An actor can receive and send messages. It can also create new actors. It has a state.
Message passing can be implemented by channels. Might want a global table of address -> channel.
You'll want something like listeners. If it's just listening for messages, loop on channel read will work.
Handle actor failure?
Actor needs state. You'll probably want initializaton fields like classes. You could just expand to a class for a simple implementation.
Actors are similar to classes, except instead of synchronous method calls, there is asynchronous message passing.
Literature suggests that addresses are a good idea. I guess when an actor is created, you only get back their address? or an actor from which you can
extract an address. That's only necessary if actors should be inspectable.

An actor has
high level:
- local state
- an address
- initialization behavior (initial field values, initialization effects, etc.)
- a message listener
low level:
- an initialization function
- a channel for messages
- a channel-reading loop
- a (preferably class-like) constructor
